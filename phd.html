<p>Today’s hardest social and technical problems have  information at their core. We’re 
seeking PhD students who have hard,  unanswered questions about information problems. 
UMD iSchool faculty and  PhD students work side-by-side to conduct research into these 
pressing  information issues. Our top-tier PhD program facilitates cutting-edge  discoveries 
and trains new generations of information studies scholars  to continue this research worldwide.</p>

<p>As the director of iSchool's doctoral program and a  researcher focused on values and ethics in technology, I'm particularly  proud of the ways that the UMD iSchool entwines social and technical  innovation. We draw on core values of information studies, including  justice, inclusion, and access, and use these principles to facilitate  the discovery of new knowledge. </p>

<p>I hope you’ll consider joining us. </p>   

<p>-Katie Shilton, Director of the PhD Program </p>



			<h2>Why a PhD in Information Studies?</h2>


				<p>The PhD program at Maryland's iSchool offers an interdisciplinary  approach to research and teaching provided by faculty at this leading  public research university. Small classes and wide-ranging research  projects enable students to work closely with faculty mentors to gain  experience in identifying knowledge gaps, investigating both theoretical  and practical solutions, evaluating results, and creating and  disseminating new knowledge. A range of required research courses, two  foundational doctoral seminars, and electives chosen by the students and  their faculty mentors provide both the structure necessary for  individuals to become successful researchers and the flexibility that  allows them to pursue the research areas about which they are most  passionate.
