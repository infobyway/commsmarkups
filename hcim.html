<p>The Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction (HCIM) program prepares students to transform the way people connect to information and to create innovative technologies with diverse users in mind.</p>

<p>In the HCIM program, students learn to design, evaluate, and implement new information technologies that are understandable, usable, and appealing to a wide variety of people. Our students develop a fundamental understanding of the technology design process, tool-building technologies, evaluation techniques, application areas for users, and the social impact of technology on the individual and community. The program prepares students to enter careers in the user experience industry or to become successful in doctoral work in a particular specialization of HCI. </p>

<h2>About the Program</h2>

<p>Our 30-credit program is typically completed in two years by full-time students, while offering flexibility to accommodate part-time and professional students. Our core curriculum grounds students in the fundamentals of HCI perspectives and methodologies, while electives offer in-depth insight into specialized areas of the field. A required internship experience provides a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience in industry or research environments, and the choice of an individual thesis or a client-based team capstone project allows students to demonstrate the skills they’ve acquired in the form best suited to their career goals.</p>

<h2>Why Study HCI at UMD?</h2>

    <ul>
    	<li>Our interdisciplinary approach integrates perspectives from information studies, computer science, design, education, psychology, and engineering, among others</li>
    	<li>Our award-winning faculty work closely with students on groundbreaking research</li>
    	<li>We are affiliated with one of the oldest HCI research labs in the world</li>
    	<li>Our curriculum is designed to accommodate students with diverse backgrounds, interests, and career goals</li>
    	<li>Our graduates go on to careers at top companies and world-class research institutions</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Building a Diverse Class</h2>

<p>We believe our program should be inclusive to students from a variety of academic and professional backgrounds. While our program is technically rigorous, we also value the perspectives of design-oriented students, and seek to strike a balance that will serve both students with computer science and engineering backgrounds and students with backgrounds in the humanities and social sciences. We have students from all stages of their careers--from recent college graduates, to young professionals, to those returning to academia after many years in industry. Wherever you’re coming from or want to go, the HCIM program can help you achieve your goals.</p>

<p>Students interested in careers within industry or government have opportunities to apply classroom insights to real-life technical problems seen within organizations in the public and private sectors. Our required internship is a key time to gain hands-on experience in a setting that matches each student’s goals, and students who undertake a capstone have the option to work with a partner in the industry.</p>

<p>Students interested in academic or industrial research can seek out opportunities with HCI faculty to work closely on innovative projects. Independent studies may present opportunities to pursue individualized research, and the thesis option allows students to undertake original research under the guidance of our award-winning faculty.</p>
